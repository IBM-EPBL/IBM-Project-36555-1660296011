# What is Phishing?
Phishing is when attackers send malicious emails designed to trick people into falling for a scam. Typically, the intent is to get users to reveal financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.

# Why this project?

Nowadays we are visiting numerous websites on our searches. We cannot assure that all the websites we are visiting is safe and legitimate.And also Phishing attacks are a constant threat to campus and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Successful Phishing attacks can:
